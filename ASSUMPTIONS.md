## Description of my solution

Talk us through your solution, thought process etc here.
1. Add a component for User. Also add one for Card and sub components for Card.
2. Use styled component for styling.
3. Use react testing library for testing.

## Things I would do next

Anything that you didn't get time to do should go here.
1. Add proper folder structure like service(if required for large appp), assests, store(if required) etc.
2. Can add redux store for large App, I didn't use it here as this is simple App.
3. Can add proper design with header and footer.
4. Can make card more stylish.
5. Can use scss.
6. Would do error handling, display proper error messages.
7. Would add more test cases using Enzyme.

## Assumptions that I made

Any assumptions that were made about the application - this could be around acceptance criteria etc.
1. I assume to display user info in a responsive card.
2. It will have a button that will add more 5 user cards to the page.
